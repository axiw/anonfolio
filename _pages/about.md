Hi. I'm Axiw. I am a graduate student in the School of Computing at Redacted advised by Prof. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fer" target="blank">Pierre de Fermat</a>. I've also spent time at <a href="https://example.com" target="blank">Redacted</a> bridging storage and networking.

My research interests are in deniability, homomorphic encryption, and post quantum cryptography. My ongoing project focuses on deniability in auctions. 

Over the next years, I will share my research and possibly other interesting insights on this website.
